# deployctl

`deployctl` is the command line tool for Deno Deploy. This repository also
contains the `denoland/deployctl` GitHub Action.

## Install

```shell
deno install --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run --no-check -r -f https://deno.land/x/deploy/deployctl.ts
```

## Usage

Before being able to deploy, you need to get a personal access token from the
[Deno Deploy access token page](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens).
Store this token in a `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` environment variable, or pass it to
`deployctl` with the `--token` flag.

```shell
deployctl deploy --project=hello-world ./examples/hello.ts
```

View the help:

```shell
deployctl -h
```

## Action Example

```yml
name: Deploy

on: push

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      id-token: write # This is required to allow the GitHub Action to authenticate with Deno Deploy.
      contents: read
